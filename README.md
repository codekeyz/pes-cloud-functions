## OverView

The whole concept is a daily contribution company receiving payments from clients and recording this payments through a mobile app (which i developed). Using Firebase Cloud Functions (going serverless), I am able to calculate and append the total transactions(amount) to the database.

_This repo was made public in order to showcase the use of async-wait in typescript._
